# Sample Agenda React TDD

> That's just a simple app for demonstration of work in TDD in React.

This app shows events of teams and hosts. Events as meetings, plannings, etc. It's just like a simple clone of Outlook.

Here is data structures of this app:

```json
{
  "team": {
    "name": "Team A",
    "email": "team@google.com",
    "department": "Cloud Store"
  },
  "host": "John Smith",
  "startsAt": "2019-05-12 11:15",
  "event": "meeting",
  "place": "Room 5",
  "comment": "Everyone must be here!"
}
```
